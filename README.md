# Some_Pong_Game
Just for the heck of it.

Wanted to try out making a regular pong "clone". This game includes a main menu for 1 or 2 player selection, but haven't got any official 
ending yet.

Have had some ideas of adding extra features to expand on the original concept, and to add networking regarding 2 player mode to learn
about that.
