# Some_Pong_Game
I feel there's something to learn from doing all the classics, so why not.

Wanted to try out making a regular pong "clone". This game includes a main menu for 1 or 2 player selection, but haven't got any official 
ending yet.

Have had some ideas of adding extra features to expand on the original concept and to add network play among other things.
